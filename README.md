*Memory Allocation*

## Task

Using C++, create a memory management unit simulator that will implement dynamic storage allocation using paging. The page size will be determined based on a command line parameter, but must be a power of 2 (between 1024 and 32768). You will not actually be spawning processes that consume memory. Rather you will be creating simulated "processes" that each make a series of memory allocations and deallocations. The following are the actions that a process can do:
 - Initialize
    - Assign a PID - unique number (start at 1024 and increment up)
    - Allocate some amount of startup memory for the process
        - Text/Code: user specified number (2048 - 16384 bytes)
        - Data/Globals: user specified number (0 - 1024 bytes)
        - Stack: constant (65536 bytes)
 - Allocate memory on the heap
    - N chars (N bytes)
    - N shorts (N * 2 bytes)
    - N ints / floats (N * 4 bytes)
    - N longs / doubles (N * 8 bytes)
 - Set value for allocated memory
    - Store integer, float, or character values in memory
 - Deallocate memory from the heap
    - N chars (N bytes)
    - N shorts (N * 2 bytes)
    - N ints / floats (N * 4 bytes)
    - N longs / doubles (N * 8 bytes)
 - Terminate
    - Deallocate all memory associated with the process

Your simulator should continually ask the user to input a command. Your program should interpret the following statements:
 - create <text_size> <data_size>
    - Initializes a new process
    - Prints the PID
 - allocate <PID> <var_name> <data_type> <number_of_elements>
    - Allocated memory on the heap (how much depends on the data type and the number of elements)
    - Print the virtual memory address
 - set <PID> <var_name> <offset> <value_0> <value_1> <value_2> ... <value_N>
    - Set the value for variable <var_name> starting at <offset>
    - Multiple contiguous values can be set with one command
 - free <PID> <var_name>
    - Deallocate memory on the heap that is associated with <var_name>
 - terminate <PID>
    - Kill the specified process
 - print <object>
    - if <object> is "mmu", print the MMU memory table
    - If <object> is "page", print the page table (do not need to print anything for free frames)
    - If <object> is "processes", print a list of PIDs for processes that are still running
    - If <object> is a "<PID>:<var_name>", print the value of the variable for that process
        - If variable has more than 4 elements, just print the first 4 followed by "... [N items]" (where N is the number of elements)
 - exit
    - quit program

Your simulated machine will only have 64 MB of RAM (67108864 bytes).

### *Features*

 - Implement the 'create', 'allocate', and 'set', 'print', and 'exit' commands
 - Each new allocation can be on a new page
 - Implement the 'free' and 'terminate' commands (8 pts)
 - Use first fit algorithm within a page when allocating new data (8 pts)
    - allocate new page if no hole is large enough
 - Print error message if an allocation would exceed system memory (and don't perform allocation) (4 pts)
